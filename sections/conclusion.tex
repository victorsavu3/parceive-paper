Visualization of software behavior is a crucial instrument to comprehend
software systems. Unfortunately, this task often involves an overwhelming
amount of trace data that easily overstrains current UIs. Therefore, we built a
highly scalable and responsive visualization infrastructure for our tracing
tool Parceive. The core is a client-server architecture providing asynchronous
event driven data retrieval and optimized analysis queries. These techniques
empower users to explore and navigate their traced applications by multiple
viewpoints. This paper additionally presented three views and a use-case that
demonstrates the usefulness of these views on identification and validation of
potential parallelism scenarios. Currently, we are in an early stage of
research. Future work will mainly cover higher-level aspects to comprehend
software systems in a top-down approach.
